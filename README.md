## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior at the University of Louisville's College of Business. There I am studying Computer Information Systems with a focus on cyber Security.
Currently I am a Infrastructure Technician at the 123 Airlift Wing where I maintain our communication Infrastructure (Switching, Routing, Voice, Encryption).
